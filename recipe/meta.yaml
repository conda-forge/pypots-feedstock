  summary: a Python toolbox for machine learning on Partially-Observed Time Series
  description: |
    PyPOTS is born to become a handy toolbox that is going to make data mining on POTS easy rather than tedious, 
    to help engineers and researchers focus more on the core problems in their hands rather than on how to deal 
    with the missing parts in their data. PyPOTS will keep integrating classical and the latest state-of-the-art 
    data mining algorithms for partially-observed multivariate time series. For sure, besides various algorithms, 
    PyPOTS is going to have unified APIs together with detailed documentation and interactive examples across 
    algorithms as tutorials.
